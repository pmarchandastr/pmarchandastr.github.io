       <h3>How stars form ?</h3>
       <p>The interstellar medium is filled with diffuse matter, that gathers into "molecular clouds". These giant structures several parsec wide can host thousands of solar mass of gas. Within these clouds, turbulent motions, gravity and feedback from nearby stars (particles, radiations) create overdense regions called "dense cores". If the gravitational force can overcome the support of the thermal and magnetic pressure, the core is unstable and collapses under its own weight. The matter becomes more and more hot and dense in the center, until the temperature is high enough to ignite the nuclear fusion reactions of hydrogen. The energy released by the fusion increases the thermal pressure within the gas. When it is sufficient to counter the pulling force of gravity, a star is born.
       
       The slight rotation of the gas in the dense cores is amplified as the gas collapses, by conservation of angular momentum. The centrifugal force creates a support against gravity, which leads to the formation of a disk. In this disk, dust grains and molecules aggregate, grow and eventually form planets, moons, asteroids. This disk is then called "protoplanetary disk".</p>



       <h2> WORK IN PROGRESS... </h2>

       <!--<h3>The angular momentum and the magnetic flux problems</h3>-->
       <!--<p>There are two main problems concerning star formation. The first is the angular momentum regulation. We know from observations that dense cores rotates too fast compared to stars. If their angular momentum (their "inertia of rotation") was conserved, as it is the case in closed systems, the collapsing gas would spin up so fast that any structure would be teared apart by the centrifugal force. In more scientific terms, dense cores have a specific angular momentum about 1000 times higher than young stars. One of the best candidates to solve this issue is the magnetic braking: while the gas rotates, the twisting of the magnetic field lines generates a magnetic tension that slows the rotation, just like a guitar cord exerts a force when it is pulled. The magnetic field carries the angular momentum away from the core back in the interstellar medium. Another mechanism that removes angular momentum from the dense core are the protostellar outflows : fast rotating gas being ejected by the combination of the magnetic and centrifugal forces.-->
       <!--The first studies used the ideal MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) to study star formation, a formalism that simply describes the behavior of a magnetized fluid. However, in this framework, the magnetic braking is so efficient that a very low amount of angular momentum remains in the core, preventing its rotation and the formation of a disk (that we know exist because we observe them. And we are pretty sure planets exist too !). This problem is known as the magnetic braking catastrophe. The second problem in star formation is also linked to the magnetic field. Similarly to the angular momentum, the flux of the magnetic field is conserved in ideal MHD, leading to unrealistically high magnetic fiels in stars (for the sun, it would be 10 millions times too high !). These problems arise because ideal MHD does not contain dissipative processes: the fluid is considered as a perfect conductor and is perfectly coupled to the magnetic field. The formalism of non-ideal MHD describes more accurately the behavior of a magnetized fluid by considering the decoupling of electrons, ions and neutral particles from the magnetic field. These effects are respectively called the Ohmic diffusion, the Hall effect and the ambipolar diffusion. Recent studies have shown that non-ideal MHD is able to redistribute the magnetic flux and temper the magnetic braking, leading to more realistic results. In <a href= https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200901268M/abstract>Marchand et al. 2020</a>, I study how the ambipolar diffusion regulates the magnetic braking, the angular momentum and the outflows in various situations.</p>-->

       <!--<h3>The Hall effect</h3>-->
       <!--<p> The Hall effect is one of the three non-ideal MHD effects, beside Ohmic diffusion and ambipolar diffusion. It decribes how ions decouple from magnetic field lines. It is the least studied of the three effect because it is difficult to handle numerically. The Hall effect can play a critical role in star formation as it is able to weaken or strengthen the magnetic braking, therefore impacting the angular momentum. In <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...619A..37M/abstract'>Marchand et al. 2018</a> and <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...631A..66M/abstract'>Marchand et al. 2019</a>, I describe its implementation in the code RAMSES, and all subsequent tests, as well as its role in core-collapse simulations.-->

       <!--<h3>Chemical abundances and ionization</h3>-->

       <!--<p>Non-ideal MHD effects heavily depend on the chemical state of the environment, typically what are the charge particles, their abundance, their mass. I have developed a code solving a chemical network to get equilibrium abundances at various densities, temperature and cosmic rays ionisation rate. The network includes 10 ionised species and several physical processes affecting the ionisation. I then use the computed chemical abundance to derive the non-ideal MHD "resistivities", that define the strength of the non-ideal MHD effects. Those resistivities are then used in numerical simulations of star formation. See <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...592A..18M'>Marchand et al. (2016)</a> for more informations. The code and the chemical abundance table are public</br>-->

       <!--<h3>Grains</h3>-->

       <!--<p>Grains are aggregates of molecules whose size vary from few nanometers to about one micrometer in the interstellar medium. They represent only 1% of the mass of the gas, but play a major role in various aspects of astrophysical processes. Their most obvious role is planet formation, which is a consequence of their growth. They are also an important chemical actor, because they can hold one to several electric charges (hence changing the ionization and influencing non-ideal MHD effects) and their surface act as a catalyst for some chemical reactions, or a trap for several chemical species at low temperature. In addition, the opacity they provide significantly affect the thermal properties of the gas, especially in protostellar environments.-->
       <!--However, although the focus of lot of studies, modeling the grains : their shape, composition, size-distribution, number, is still a challenge and often necessitates complex chemical codes and experiments because they undergo a lot of physical processes. Accretion and coagulation make them grow, shattering and fragmentation breaks them. Their shapes are fractals with a lot of porosity. In star formation, coagulation (two grains colliding and sticking to each other) is the main process affecting their size. Although coagulation is reasonably uncomplicated to compute, it is extremely numerically expensive : it takes a lot of time and slows down simulations. However, I have recently developed a fast method to track the coagulation and ionization of spherical grains (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210300002M/abstract">Marchand et al 2021</a>). I have used it in numerical simulations and found that grains can grow from sub-micron sizes to more than 100 micron in the disk in less than 1000 years. This has dramatic consequences on the physical processes in protoplanetary disks, as planet formation, temperature regulation and angular momentum distribution. I show, for example, that with grain coagulation, disks are smaller than without grain coagulation, proving that taking grain growth into account is critical.-->
